# System Audit Report: AI-Pedagogy Digital Garden

**Date:** June 20, 2026  
**Project Path:** `.`  
**SSG Framework:** Quartz v5.0.0 (Quartz 4 TSX/Preact-based architecture)

---

## 1. Core Project Identity & Architecture

### Conceptual & Technical Framework

The `ai-pedagogy` project is structured as a **local Obsidian Vault** that serves as a digital garden and cognitive extension. It is compiled and served as a static site using **Quartz v5.0.0** (built on a Preact, lightningcss, and unified/remark processing framework).

Conceptually, the vault details **Pyragogy**—an evolutionary handbook mapping pedagogical frameworks, practices, and capabilities designed to preserve human intellectual sovereignty, intentional agency, and effortful reasoning (cognitive friction) in an age of automated AI scaffolding.

### Exact Directory Layout Verification

The root directory `.` contains the following critical system and structure files:

- [quartz.config.yaml](../../quartz.config.yaml): Defines configuration options, plugin parameters, color theme, typography, and page layout structure.
- [package.json](../../package.json): Handles dependencies (Preact, chokidar, lightningcss, workerpool, etc.) and execution scripts (`quartz` bootstrap, build, test). Engines require `node >=22` and `npm >=10.9.2`.
- [quartz/styles/custom.scss](../../quartz/styles/custom.scss): Declares custom Sass style overrides targeting layout alignment, graph sizing, transitions, and hover interactions.
- `.obsidian/`: Contains configuration files (`app.json`, `core-plugins.json`, `graph.json`, etc.) that configure the folder as a native Obsidian Vault.
- `content/`: Root folder for all markdown documentation, divided into evolutionary taxonomy paths.

## 2. Visual System & Layout Audit

### Theme & Color Palette

The color theme is defined in `quartz.config.yaml` under `theme.colors`. Notably, both `lightMode` and `darkMode` are mapped to the same dark aesthetic palette:

| HSL/Hex Token             | Category Name   | Color Role in UI                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#050506`                 | `light`         | Main page background (Near-black)                                  |
| `#18181b`                 | `lightgray`     | Borders, divider lines, and component containers                   |
| `#52525b`                 | `gray`          | Meta-text, reading time, dates, and subtitle lines                 |
| `#d4d4d8`                 | `darkgray`      | Main body/paragraph text (High-contrast light gray)                |
| `#ffffff`                 | `dark`          | Primary page headers (`h1`, `h2`), page titles, and strong text    |
| `#10b981` / `#34d399`     | `secondary`     | Links, folder tree nodes, active files (Elegant Emerald Green)     |
| `#059669` / `#10b981`     | `tertiary`      | Backlink items, hover states, tag links, graph nodes (Medium Green) |
| `rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.14)` / `rgba(52, 211, 153, 0.14)` | `highlight` | Block quotes and code block backgrounds |
| `rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.22)` / `rgba(52, 211, 153, 0.22)` | `textHighlight` | Highlighted search results & text highlights |

### Typography

Font families are fetched via Google Fonts (`fontOrigin: googleFonts` and `cdnCaching: true` enabled):

- **Header Font:** `Fraunces`
- **Body Font:** `Inter`
- **Code Font:** `JetBrains Mono`

### Layout Balancing & Structural Overrides

The site layout balances information across a three-column desktop presentation:

1.  **Left Sidebar (Navigation):** Houses the `page-title` ("AI-Augmented Pedagogy Handbook"), the search bar (`search`, grouped in toolbar), darkmode/reader-mode controls, and the `explorer` plugin (configured with the title `"Syllabus"`, collapsed by default).
2.  **Central Content Column:** Includes a `breadcrumbs` trail (omitted on index pages), `article-title`, `note-properties` (displays metadata for `description`, `tags`, and `aliases`), and `content-meta` (reading speed metadata), followed by the compiled markdown body.
3.  **Right Interactive Sidebar:** Hosts the interactive network `graph` visualization, `table-of-contents` index, and `backlinks`.

### Layout Stability & Transitions (`custom.scss`)

- **Sidebar Alignment:** Overrides on `body .page > .sidebar` force a reset of `margin-top: 0 !important` and add a `padding-top: 1rem !important`. Children components are restricted to `margin-bottom: 1.5rem` to prevent vertical alignment mismatch and height jitter during load.
- **Graph Bounds:** The class `.graph-outer` is strictly bounded to `height: 200px !important; margin: 0 !important;` to stabilize the sidebar space and prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) when the SVG elements compile.
- **Micro-Animations:**
  - Syllabus explorer directories and files shift padding (`padding-left: 6px`) and shift text color to `var(--tertiary)` (Green) over a `0.2s` transition on hover.
  - Folder child bullets (`ul.tree-item-children`) transition their left-border color to `var(--secondary)` (Emerald) on hover.
  - Graph nodes (`svg circle`) expand their radius `r: 6px` on hover and change their colors to green fill and emerald stroke over a cubic-bezier transition.

## 3. Content Ingestion & Taxonomy Structure

### Evolutionary Folder Taxonomy

The `content/` files are structured into 4 folders representing an ontogenetic sequence of cognitive growth:

1.  `01_foundations/`: Contains foundational configuration blueprints.
2.  `02_early_development/`: Addresses early-childhood sensory-motor portals.
3.  `03_co_agency/`: Details human-AI co-agency, Socratic dialogue, and professional hybrid intelligence.
4.  `04_systemic_risks/`: Covers critical cognitive risks, over-reliance, and algorithmic dependencies.

### Semantic Nodes & Handbooks

There are **14 active semantic nodes** representing practices, capabilities, and risks. The files are distributed as follows:

| Folder / Taxonomy Route | File Name                     | Node Type (`kind`) | Title / Concept                                           | Key Epistemic Relations                                                                                           |

_(Note: `content/01_foundations/blueprint.md` has `draft: true` set and is compiled out of final production output via the `remove-draft` plugin)._

### Frontmatter Schema Verification

All 14 active semantic nodes implement a uniform YAML frontmatter schema:

- `id`: String matching the filename (e.g. `"toddler_book"`).
- `title`: Full descriptive title string.
- `kind`: Categorization (`"practice"`, `"capability"`, or `"risk"`).
- `ontogeny`: Floating-point developmental sequence index ($X$-axis, e.g. `1.2` to `8.8`).
- `praxis`: Floating-point cognitive effort index ($Y$-axis, e.g. `0.0` to `8.5`).
- `autonomy`: Floating-point agency self-sovereignty index ($Z$-axis, e.g. `0.5` to `9.5`).
- `tags`: Markdown categories array (`pyragogy` along with its sub-category, e.g. `pyragogy/practice`).

### Obsidian Wikilinks & landing Page

- **Wikilinks Resolution:** Quartz parses wikilinks natively through the `obsidian-flavored-markdown` plugin. Link matching is configured with `markdownLinkResolution: shortest`, meaning Quartz dynamically maps short wikilink structures (e.g. `[[toddler_book]]`) directly to their nested targets without needing absolute paths.
- **Landing Page Structure:** `content/index.md` serves as the entry index. It links directly to the three core handbooks (toddler, adolescent, and adult books) in a "Core Bookshelf" section and features an Obsidian-native Dataview block.
- **Dataview Compatibility:** Because the dataview parsing engine is proprietary to the Obsidian application ecosystem and no Quartz translation plugin is registered in `quartz.config.yaml`, the Dataview code block will render as a raw markdown code block on the static generated site.

## 4. Verification and Dry-Run Build Results

A clean verification run was executed using the Quartz compiler:

- **Source files detected:** 20 markdown inputs (1 index, 19 sub-notes/indexes).
- **Draft filtration:** `1 file` (`blueprint.md`) was successfully filtered out as expected.
- **Compile state:** Compilation succeeded cleanly, writing 106 static assets (including JSON graph indexes and HTML files) into the `public` deployment folder in 6 seconds.
